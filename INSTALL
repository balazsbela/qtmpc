Windows
-------------------
Simply run:

- qmake
- make release
- release/QtMPC.exe

Linux
-------------------
For KDE users:

- "cd" to QtMPC directory
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr  # NOTE: "/usr" can be something different on your system
- make
- make install

For non-KDE users:

- "cd" to QtMPC directory
- qmake
- make
- ./QtMPC   # NOTE: You can put the binary in /usr/local/bin for example

NOTE: If you have KDE on your system but want to forcefully disable support for it,
      you can add "-DWANT_KDE_SUPPORT=NO" to the cmake line

NOTE 2: If you're not using KDE but have cmake installed, you can follow the cmake
        procedure as well. "make install" just won't work.
